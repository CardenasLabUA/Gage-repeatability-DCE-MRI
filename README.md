# Gage-repeatability-DCE-MRI
Code for the simulation and analysis of Gage repeatability of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI data.

Abstract

Purpose:
To determine the effect that linearization has on the repeatability of the linear (LRRM) and non-linear (NRRM) reference region models for DCE MRI, and compare their repeatability to semi-quantitative methods of analysis.

Materials And Methods: Simulated DCE-MRI data and experimental DCE-MRI data from a flank glioma tumor model were analyzed using the LRRM and NRRM to estimate RKtrans, and with semi-quantitative methods to estimate the maximum enhancement ratio (MER), time to peak (TTP), initial area under the curve (iauc64), and slope. The within subject coefficient of variation (wSCV) and the percent intra-subject variation determined (iSV) with Gage R&R analysis were calculated to compare repeatability.  

Results:  The wSCV for RKtrans using pixelwise analysis was 1.26 and 2.27 for LRRM and NRRM respectively.  

The experimental iSV for RKtrans using LRRM was 45.1 %, while using the NRRM results in a iSV of 79.0%. The iSV for semi-quantitaitive metrics were:  MER=46.1 %,  Slope=50.9 %, TTP =88.7 %, iauc64=46.5 %.
